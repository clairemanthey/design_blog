How to start using semantic HTML? It’s easy to wrap elements into divs or use a span tag. When designing a website take some time to plan out the content and what its purpose is on your website.Think about what each part of the content is doing and how it relates to the other content. Then use the tag with the appropriate meaning for the element.

The main tag should be used to wrap the main content of your website. Then tags such as section and article can be used inside a main tag. For navigation use the nav tag instead of a div tag. Every time you see a div or span tag, take a moment and ask if there is a semantic tag that would be a good fit for this content. Taking that moment and looking over the HTML to see where semantic tags can be used makes a website accessible to more people and optimizes SEO.
