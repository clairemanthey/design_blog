## Introduction
Welcome to the repo for my blog about learning web design. It covers concepts starting with HTML, then adding CSS and JS tracing my journey learning and using those concepts to create websites and web applications. 

My blog was created using React and Gatsby, using the [Gatsby personal starter blog](https://github.com/thomaswangio/gatsby-personal-starter-blog). Then I customized the blog by adding functionality with features and then creating my own components.Then was connected to the Netlify CMS to manage content and deployed using Netlify with continuous development managed using a github repo.


## Motivation

I created this project to learn different aspects of React and get more comfortable using React doing things such as making my own custom components and adding functionality. I also wanted to use a new framework, Gatsby, and another CMS, Netlify CMS.

I also wanted to document my learning journey of web design. Starting with the basics of HTML and creating a markup file to how to use semantic HTML. Then incorporating CSS concepts and using JavaScript to make responsive dynamic web applications.

## How to Get Started with Gatsby

Get started using Gatsby by installing the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-cli/) and the [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli). Then start a directory with cd-my-gatsby-site or choose from their [library of starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/). 
Gatsby requires a minimal Node.js version 14.15.0
